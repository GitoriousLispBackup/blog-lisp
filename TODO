TODO

- make-handler should replace existing handler if it exists
  instead of always adding to the front of the list

- Figure out how to show the index at / without clobbering the
  other dispatch routes

- Add docstrings where appropriate

- Add pagination (I'll probably have enough entries soon)

- Add an RSS feed (maybe?)

- Add authentication to the write pages

- Add a way to save entry drafts. Maybe make them available by URL if
  you know the URL without posting it to the index page (and RSS feed,
  when that's added). That way I could send the link to other people
  to have them review it before it's done.
